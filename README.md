# neighbouring-countries

### This is a Team Project. Together with my teammates we create a webpage to show general information about world countries and their neighbours. We leave users the freedom to choose which country, which neighbour of that country or what information about that country they want to see.

### For this purpose we use HTML, Bootstrap and Javascript.

### We have the opportunity to work with Bootstrap and some concepts related to CSS basics and DOM manipulation.
